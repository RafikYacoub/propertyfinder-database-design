List of Design Assumptions used in database project, milestone 1


1. Every agent works for only one broker company.
2. The primary key for the broker company is the name since the email cannot be accessed from the website.
3. Every development project name is unique. If the project has a developer, it will be recorded.
4. There is a unique ID for every property which works as its primary key.
5. Every email address is unique, and it's the primary key in the user and agent entities.
6. All prices are in EGP.
7. Every development project name is unique.
8. If no explicit agent is selling the property, the broker company will have an agent by its name (broker company name 
agent eg el rewad agent which works in el rewad real estate company) to sell the property under its name.

Note: The above assumptions are open to being updated (if needed) in future milestones.
